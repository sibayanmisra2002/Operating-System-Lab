Rajeshâ€™s basic salary (BASIC) is input through the keyboard. His dearness allowance (DA) is 52% of BASIC. House rent allowance (HRA) is 15% of BASIC. Contributory provident fund is 12% of (BASIC + DA). Write a shell script to calculate his gross salary and take home salary using the following formula: Gross salary = BASIC + DA + HRA Take home salary = Gross salary - (BASIC + DA) * 0.12

#!/bin/sh

echo "enter the salary"
read basic_salary
if [ $basic_salary -ge 0 ]
then
        basic=$(expr 1.0*"$basic_salary" | bc)
        echo "basic is $basic"
        da=$(expr 0.52*"$basic" | bc)
        echo "da is $da"
        hr=$(expr 0.15*"$basic" | bc)
        echo "hr is $hr"
        temp=$(expr "$basic"+"$da" | bc)
        echo " temp is $temp"
        pa=$(expr 0.12*"$temp" | bc)
        echo "pa is $pa"
        gs=$(expr "$basic"+"$da"+"$hr" | bc)
        echo "gs is $gs"
        ths=$(expr "$gs"-"$pa" | bc )
         echo "take home salary is $ths"
        else
       echo "not correct"

Write a shell script to print the following pattern for any number of lines: 
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
#!/bin/sh

rows=5
for((i=1; i<=rows; i++))
do
  for((j=1; j<=rows - i; j++))
  do
    echo -n "  "
  done
  for((j=1; j<=2*i - 1; j++))
  do
    echo -n "* "
  done
  echo

Write a shell script to test whether a given string is palindrome or not.

#!/bin/sh

echo "Input the string without space"
read str

for i in $(seq 0 ${#str}) ; do
        revstr=${str:$i:1}$revstr
done

echo "The given string is " $str
echo "Its reverse is " $revstr

if [ "$str" = "$revstr" ]; then
        echo "It is a palindrome."
else
        echo "It is not a palindrome."
fi

Write a shell script which counts the number of consonants and vowels in a given sentence.

#!/bin/sh

echo -n "Enter a line of text: "

read string

numCount=$(echo $string | grep -o "[0-9]" | wc --lines)

vowCount=$(echo $string | grep -o -i "[aeiou]" | wc --lines)

consCount=$(echo $string | grep -o -i "[bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz]" | wc --lines)
echo "The given string has $vowCount vowels, $consCount consonants and $numCount numbers in it."
