Write a shell program that takes a number from user and prints the reverse of the number.

echo enter n
read n
num=0
while [ $n -gt 0 ]
do
num=$(expr $num \* 10)
k=$(expr $n % 10)
num=$(expr $num + $k)
n=$(expr $n / 10)
done
echo number is $num

Write a shell script to find whether a number is divisible by 11.

#!/bin/sh
echo "Enter the divident"

read n

echo "Enter the divisor"

read m

y=`expr $n % $m`

if [ $y -eq 0 ]

then

echo " $n is divisible by $m "

else

echo " $n not divisible by $m "

fi

Write a shell script that produces a shell calculator to perform the following operations: • Addition • Subtraction • Multiplication • Division 

# !/bin/bash

# Take user Input
echo "Enter Two numbers : "
read a
read b

# Input type of operation
echo "Enter Choice :"
echo "1. Addition"
echo "2. Subtraction"
echo "3. Multiplication"
echo "4. Division"
read ch

# Switch Case to perform
# calculator operations
case $ch in
1)res=`echo $a + $b | bc`
;;
2)res=`echo $a - $b | bc`
;;
3)res=`echo $a \* $b | bc`
;;
4)res=`echo "scale=2; $a / $b" | bc`
;;
esac
echo "Result : $res"
